abstract = {This paper presents an inkjet printing method for the fabrication of entire microfluidic multianalyte chemical sensing devices made from paper suitable for quantitative analysis, requiring only a single printing apparatus. An inkjet printing device is used for the fabrication of three-dimensional hydrophilic microfluidic patterns (550-mum-wide flow channels) and sensing areas (1.5 mm x 1.5 mm squares) on filter paper, by inkjet etching, and thereby locally dissolving a hydrophobic poly(styrene) layer obtained by soaking of the filter paper in a 1 wt {\%} solution of poly(styrene) in toluene. In a second step, the same inkjet printing device is used to print "chemical sensing inks", comprising the necessary reagents for colorimetric analytical assays, into well-defined areas of the patterned microfluidic paper devices. The arrangement of the patterns, printed inks, and sensing areas was optimized to obtain homogeneous color responses. The results are "all-inkjet-printed" chemical sensing devices for the simultaneous determination of pH, total protein, and glucose in clinically relevant concentration ranges for urine analysis (0.46-46 muM for human serum albumin, 2.8-28.0 mM for glucose, and pH 5-9). Quantitative data are obtained by digital color analysis in the L*a*b* color space by means of a color scanner and a simple computer program.},

We used a digital camera for the quantitative analysis of glucose with the S co- ordinate of the HSV color space as the analytical parameter.

abstract = {The emerging concept of thread-based microfluidics has shown great promise for application to inexpensive disease detection and environmental monitoring. To allow the creation of more sophisticated and functional thread-based sensor designs, the ability to better control and understand the flow of fluids in the devices is required. To meet this end, various mechanisms for controlling the flow of reagents and samples in thread-based microfluidic devices are investigated in this study. A study of fluid penetration in single threads and in twined threads provides greater practical understanding of fluid velocity and ultimate penetration for the design of devices. "Switches" which control when or where flow can occur, or allow the mixing of multiple fluids, have been successfully prototyped from multifilament threads, plastic films, and household adhesive. This advancement allows the fabrication of more functional sensory devices which can incorporate more complex detection chemistries, while maintaining low production cost and simplicity of construction. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Many common and inexpensive materials, such as, paper, fabric and thread are currently being explored as alternate substrates for low-cost and field-based sensing applications. While these substrates have primarily been utilized to develop low-cost diagnostic devices, it is important to study whether these materials are suitable for more general chemical sensing applications. Here, we report chemical syntheses (inorganic and organic) and sensing using threads as microchannels. We first characterized the liquid transport through thread channels and then measured typical sample losses due to adsorption and evaporation. Next, we demonstrated synthesis of ferric hydroxide in a Y-geometry thread reactor and detected the product by colorimetry. Our low-cost device gave a product yield of 84{\%} compared to a test tube-based synthesis. We also synthesized (with ∼72{\%} yield) and detected colorless 2,4-dichloro-N-(2-morpholinoethyl) benzamide in an attempt to demonstrate an organic reaction in a thread device. Finally, we successfully detected bovine serum albumin and the glucose present in blood plasma as examples of detection of chemical substances relevant in diagnostics. Our results indicate that cotton and silk threads are indeed suitable materials for incorporation into field-deployable disposable chemical reaction and sensing systems. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The background regarding colour spaces and recent analytical system architectures of interest in analytical chemistry is presented in the formof a tutorial. Moreover, issues regarding images, such as the influence of illuminants, and the most relevant techniques for processing and analysing digital images are addressed. Some of the most relevant applications are then detailed, highlighting their main characteristics. Finally, our opinion about future perspectives is discussed.},

A thread can transport liquid via capillary wicking without the need of a barrier; as it is stainable, it is also a desirable material for displaying colorimetric results. When used in sewing, threads have 3D passageways in sewed materials. The wicking property and flexibility of thread make it particularly suitable to fabricate 3D microfluidic devices. Threads can also be used with other materials (e.g., paper) to make microfluidic devices for rapid qualitative or semiquantitative analysis. These thread-based and thread-paper-based devices have potential applications in human health diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and food safety analysis, and are particularly appropriate for the developing world or remote areas, because of their relatively low fabrication costs.},

abstract = {In this work, an Android application for measurement of nitrite concentration and pH determination in combination with a low-cost paper-based microfluidic device is presented. The application uses seven sensing areas, containing the corresponding immobilized reagents, to produce selective color changes when a sample solution is placed in the sampling area. Under controlled conditions of light, using the flash of the smartphone as a light source, the image captured with the built-in camera is processed using a customized algorithm for multidetection of the colored sensing areas. The developed image-processing allows reducing the influence of the light source and the positioning of the microfluidic device in the picture. Then, the H (hue) and S (saturation) coordinates of the HSV color space are extracted and related to pH and nitrite concentration, respectively. A complete characterization of the sensing elements has been carried out as well as a full description of the image analysis for detection. The results show good use of a mobile phone as an analytical instrument. For the pH, the resolution obtained is 0.04 units of pH, 0.09 of accuracy, and a mean squared error of 0.167. With regard to nitrite, 0.51{\%} at 4.0 mg L(-1) of resolution and 0.52 mg L(-1) as the limit of detection was achieved.},

Renewable and continuous siphonage flow allowed replicate sampling and detection on one channel/device, obviating some possible inconsistencies among channels or devices. Y-shaped channels were fabricated with polyester cotton blend thread, due to its greater chemiluminescent sensitivity in comparison with that of cotton and polyester threads. S-$\mu$TAD sensors for glucose and uric acid were fabricated by using oxidase-immobilized cotton thread as the sample arm of the channels. The acceptable reproducibility and high sensitivity, demonstrated by the relative standard deviations of less than 5{\%} in all cases and the detection limits of 4 × 10(-8) mol L(-1) for hydrogen peroxide, 1 × 10(-7) mol L(-1) for glucose, and 3 × 10(-6) mol L(-1) for uric acid, demonstrated the feasibility of the S-$\mu$TAD for quantitative assays. Good agreements between S-$\mu$TAD/sensor results and hospital results for blood glucose and uric acid assays indicated the capability of S-$\mu$TAD/sensors for the analysis of real samples. These findings proved the utility of siphonage for low-cost microfluidics and the suitability of our S-$\mu$TAD design for quantitative assays.},

Hydrophilic multifilament threads are capable of transporting aqueous and non-aqueous fluids via capillary action and possess desirable properties for building fluid transport pathways in microfluidic devices. Thread can be sewn onto various support materials to form fluid transport channels without the need for the patterned hydrophobic barriers essential for paper-based microfluidic devices. Thread can also be used to manufacture fabrics which can be patterned to achieve suitable hydrophilic-hydrophobic contrast, creating hydrophilic channels which allow the control of fluids flow. Furthermore, well established textile patterning methods and combination of hydrophilic and hydrophobic threads can be applied to fabricate low-cost microfluidic devices that meet the low-cost and low-volume requirements. In this paper, we review the current limitations and shortcomings of multifilament thread and textile-based microfluidics, and the research efforts to date on the development of fluid flow control concepts and fabrication methods. We also present a summary of different methods for modelling the fluid capillary flow in microfluidic thread and textile-based systems. Finally, we summarized the published works of thread surface treatment methods and the potential of combining multifilament thread with other materials to construct devices with greater functionality. We believe these will be important research focuses of thread- and textile-based microfluidics in future.},

abstract = {This work presents a microfluidic paper-based analytical device ($\mu$PAD) for glucose determination using a supported metal-organic framework (MOF) acting as a peroxidase mimic. The catalytic action of glucose oxidase (GOx) on glucose causes the formation of H2O2, and the MOF causes the oxidation of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) by H2O2 to form a blue-green product with an absorption peak at 650 nm in the detection zone. A digital camera and the iOS feature of a smartphone are used for the quantitation of glucose with the S coordinate of the HSV color space as the analytical parameter. Different factors such as the concentration of TMB, GOx and MOF, pH and buffer, sample volume, reaction time and reagent position in the $\mu$PAD were optimized. Under optimal conditions, the value for the S coordinate increases linearly up to 150 $\mu$mol{\textperiodcentered}L−1 glucose concentrations, with a 2.5 $\mu$mol{\textperiodcentered}L−1 detection limit. The $\mu$PAD remains stable for 21 days under conventional storage conditions. Such an enzyme mimetic-based assay to glucose determination using Fe-MIL-101 MOF implemented in a microfluidic paper-based device possesses advantages over enzyme-based assays in terms of costs, durability and stability compared to other existing glucose determination methods. The procedure was applied to the determination of glucose in (spiked) serum and urine.},

@article{Wu2015,
abstract = {In this work, we first report a facile, low-cost and high-throughput method for photolithographical fabrication of microfluidic cloth-based analytical devices ($\mu$CADs) by simply using a cotton cloth as a substrate material and employing an inexpensive hydrophobic photoresist laboratory-formulated from commercially available reagents, which allows patterning of reproducible hydrophilic-hydrophobic features in the cloth with well-defined and uniform boundaries. Firstly, we evaluated the wicking properties of cotton cloths by testing the wicking rate in the cloth channel, in combination with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analyses. It is demonstrated that the wicking properties of the cloth microfluidic channel can be improved by soaking the cloth substrate in 20 wt{\%} NaOH solution and by washing the cloth-based microfluidic patterns with 3 wt{\%} SDS solution. Next, we studied the minimum dimensions achievable for the width of the hydrophobic barriers and hydrophilic channels. The results indicate that the smallest width for a desired hydrophobic barrier is designed to be 100 $\mu$m and that for a desired hydrophilic channel is designed to be 500 $\mu$m. Finally, the high-throughput $\mu$CADs prepared using the developed fabrication technique were demonstrated for colorimetric assays of glucose and protein in artificial urine samples. It has been shown that the photolithographically patterned $\mu$CADs have potential for a simple, quantitative colorimetric urine test. The combination of cheap cloth and inexpensive high-throughput photolithography enables the development of new types of low-cost cloth-based microfluidic devices, such as "microzone plates" and "gate arrays", which provide new methods to perform biochemical assays or control fluid flow.},
